# Upload any image files here that you want to use during development.
You'll be able to call them from Twine using standard html image tags

Here's an example: The only image stored in this directory is "cat.jpg"
The url for it is: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bioclockstudio-UCSD/EntrainmentSimulator/master/cat.jpg

When you upload an image here, call it using the same url, just change "cat.jpg" to your file's name.
